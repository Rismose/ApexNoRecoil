# Apex No Recoil Script | Rismose
- **Up to date working AHK Scripts**
- **Featuring many of the popular Apex Legends Weapons**

## Insalling
**To use the script, you first have to download [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/).**

**AHK is a scripting lanugage for Windows.**

**---**

**After you have installed AHK you need to download the github repo as a .zip file. In the .zip file you will find this `readme.md` file and a `.ahk` file.**

**To run the script, all you have to do is open the `.ahk` file as administrator.**

**Once in the script you will be met with a menu. The settings with a <font color='gree'>GREEN</font> text are up to date. While the settings with <font color='red'>RED</font> text have yet to be updated!**




## Configuration

**If you feel like you don't want to use the default 2.8 mouse sensitivity, or you feel like you could contribute with fixing some of the yet unfixed spray patterns, you can change the code on your own. Right click the `.ahk` script and open it with a supported text program. I use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).**

***SENSITIVITY***
**To change your sensitivity, right click on the file as previously mentioned, and open the code in a supported editor. The part you want to change is this: `sens:=2.8` and it should be located under `-----user settings-----`**

***SPRAY PATTERNS***
**If you would like to contribute changing the spray patterns and you know what you are doing, you can always open up the code in a supported code editor and change the values yourself. Here is a sneakpeak on how the values look: 
`r99_pattern := {1: "0,5,53", 2: "0,5,53", 3: "0,0,53"
,4: "0,5,53", 5: "0,10,53", 6: "0,10,53"
,7: "0,10,53", 8: "0,10,53", 9: "0,10,52"
,10: "0,10,52", 11: "0,10,52", 12: "0,10,52"
,13: "0,10,52", 14: "0,10,52", 15: "0,10,52"
,16: "0,10,52", 17: "0,10,52", 18: "0,10,52"
,19: "0,5,52", 20: "0,5,52", 21: "0,5,52"
,22: "0,5,52", 23: "0,5,52", 24: "0,5,52"
,25: "0,5,52", 26: "0,5,52", 27: "0,5,52"
,28: "0,5,52", 29: "0,5,52", 30: "0,5,52"}`. 
The values are written in an XY grid that is easily editable.**

**If you feel nice enough you can even make a pull request for me to implement your changes!**
